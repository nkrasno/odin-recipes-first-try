# odin-recipes

This project will display links to a few recipes. It's not going to be very pretty since no CSS will we added to it (yet). 

The propose of this is to practice what was learnt in the HTML introduction lessons of The Odin Project.

## update

I made a few mistakes when creating some commits on this project (and I'll probably will make more in the next try), so I'm renaming it to indicate that this was the first attempt. 
I would also like to do some things different when coding the HTML files for the recipes.
